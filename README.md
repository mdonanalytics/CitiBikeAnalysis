# Actions
-  Business can see who their core audience is while also looking at opportunity areas for the demographic that can help grow the business even further.

# Summary
Overall the findings show that the predominat users of Citi Bikes are male users who most likely commute to work in the lower Manhattan area during week days. These are also the users that are paying to use the platform due to consistency. The timing of the rides are fairly short with majority peaking around 5-6 minutes and is most likely due to the proiximity of subways in the city or proiximity of Citi bike stations.

To gain further customer insights I would perform 2 more analysis to add on. 
- One would be an analysis of the stores or envrionment around the highest usage areas to better build a customer profile.
- Secondly would be analyzing the relationship between the temperature and the bike usage, to see how to better drive usage during colder or hotter months.
